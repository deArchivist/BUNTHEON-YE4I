# AI Learning Buddy - Comprehensive Documentation

## üìö Project Overview

AI Learning Buddy is a Telegram Mini App designed to serve as an educational companion for students. It integrates several learning tools into a single, accessible interface within the Telegram messaging platform. The app leverages modern web technologies and the Telegram Bot API to deliver a seamless educational experience.
